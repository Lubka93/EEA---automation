## Login functionality testing

#### Tests are written for web app https://demoqa.com/login

I automated all test cases for login functionality from excel file [Login functionality  - Test cases]().

##Precondition:

**!!! Before each automated test suite run, it is necessary to manually register at https://demoqa.com/register using the following credentials:**

- **First Name: Lubka**

- **Password: Lubka123@**

**Run Cypress Tests:**

- 1. **To run all tests in headless mode**
        ```bash
        npm run runner
        ```
- 2. **To run all tests in headed mode**
        ```bash
        npm run runnerH
        ```

The automatically generated test report (using Mochawesome) summarizes all failed tests and includes videos and screenshots. [Report from automation]()
